## ENGLISH

I had English practice from many sources across multiple fields, and mostly they are as follows:

### elite high school

my middle school and high school curriculums were entirely in English from UK sources even though it is in a relatively behind Arabic country.

### tutoring

they say the best way to learn is by teaching, I have an abundance of experience teaching many levels of English to many people ranging from general English to ielts/toefl preparation.

### constant usage

in the last 10 years I have used English in a gradually increasing manner until it became my main language, in the last 4 years I have used it more than any language
